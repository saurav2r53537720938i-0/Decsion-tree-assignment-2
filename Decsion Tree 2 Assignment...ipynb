    "1. Cleaning missing values: we will handle missing values by either imputing them replacig missing value with a calculated estimate or removing them based and the extent of missinginess\n",
    "2. Removing outliers:Outliers can be identified using statistal method such as z-score,iqr interquartile range,or domain knowldege once identified outliers can be removed or adjusted based on the specfic requirments of the analysis.\n",
    "3. Transforming categorical variable into dummy variable:This involves converting categorical variable converting categorical variables into a set of binaryvariable"

    "To interpret a decsion tree,we need to analyze the splits and leaves to identify the most important variable and threshold.This typically involves looking ata features that result in the largest information gain or decrease in impurity at each split.by examining the branches and leaves we can observe which variables at the top of the tree ,often refrred to as the top of the tree often refrred to as the root node,is usually the most important one in terms of preicting the outcome.For example if we are analyzing a decsion tree for predcting whether a customer will purchase a product the root node might reprsent a demograpic variable such as age the branches and leaves stemming from this node would then split based on difrrent age ranges withh each branch reprsenting a subset of customers with similar agess the leaves at the end of each branch would reprsent the predicted outcome"
